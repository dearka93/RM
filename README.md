A webbtemplate / boilerplate for smaller websites and webbapplications using PHP.

Built by Guanglei Huang during the course “Databaser och objektorienterad programmering i PHP" at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola.

There are three main folders. These are src, theme, and webroot.

The 'src' folder includes all php classes and functions.
The 'theme' folder contains a render.php file which includes index.php to display content and helps extract all data from the array. The index.php contains basic html document structure and elements, and the extracted variables are used to display content within the elements.
The 'webroot' folder is where you put all created php files. Config.php allow user to have personal configurations.
